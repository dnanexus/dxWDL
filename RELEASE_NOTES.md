# Release Notes

## 0.24
- Support resource requirements (memory/disk) calculated from runtime variables.

## 0.23
- Rebuild an applet, only if the source code has changed. For example,
if an applet's WDL code changed, it will be rebuilt in the next compilation.

## 0.22
- Files are lazily downloaded in auxiliary applets, such as scatters. In
  tasks/applets, they are always downloaded.

## 0.21
- Adding linking information to applets that call other applets. This
ensures the correct applet-ids are invoked. No lookup by name
is performed at runtime.
- Minor bug fixes

## 0.20
- Separate compilation of workflows and tasks. A task is compiled to
single dx:applet, and a workflow is compiled to auxiliary applets and
a dx:workflow.
- WDL files containing only tasks, and no workflow, are supported
- Many improvements all around

## 0.13
- Upgrade to wdl4s v0.10
- Improving version number handling
- Minor improvements in debugging printout and error reporting

2. Bug fixes:
  * Correct order of scatter output arrays
  * Improved handling of optionals

## 0.11
1. Better compilation error messages
2. Version checking
3. Compiler verbose mode
4. Renamed initial workflow stage to Common
