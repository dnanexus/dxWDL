# Release Notes

## 0.27
- Support the import directive. This allows spreading definitions
  across multiple files.
- Using native wdl4s data structures, instead of pretty printing, for
  internal representation.

## 0.26
- Support passing unbound variables to calls inside scatters
- Implemented glob and size function for files
- Correctly handling empty arrays in task input/output
- Improved scatter linking. Got rid of runtime calls to get dx:applet descriptions.

## 0.25
- Allow a docker image to be specified as a parameter
- Use Travis containers for continuous integration
- Adding tests for instance type choice at runtime

## 0.24
- Support resource requirements (memory/disk) calculated from runtime variables.

## 0.23
- Rebuild an applet, only if the source code has changed. For example,
if an applet's WDL code changed, it will be rebuilt in the next compilation.

## 0.22
- Files are lazily downloaded in auxiliary applets, such as scatters. In
  tasks/applets, they are always downloaded.

## 0.21
- Adding linking information to applets that call other applets. This
ensures the correct applet-ids are invoked. No lookup by name
is performed at runtime.
- Minor bug fixes

## 0.20
- Separate compilation of workflows and tasks. A task is compiled to
single dx:applet, and a workflow is compiled to auxiliary applets and
a dx:workflow.
- WDL files containing only tasks, and no workflow, are supported
- Many improvements all around

## 0.13
- Upgrade to wdl4s v0.10
- Improving version number handling
- Minor improvements in debugging printout and error reporting

## 0.12
- The GATK pipeline compiles and runs (result not validated yet)
- Bug fixes:
  * Correct order of scatter output arrays
  * Improved handling of optionals

## 0.11
- Better compilation error messages
- Version checking
- Compiler verbose mode
- Renamed initial workflow stage to Common
