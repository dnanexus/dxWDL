# Missing arguments

A workflow with missing call arguments is legal in WDL. For example,
workflow `trivial` calls task `add` with parameter `a` where
parameters `a` and `b` are required. If the user supplies
`b` at runtime, the workflow will execute correctly, otherwise, a
*missing argument* error will result.

```
workflow trivial {
    input {
      Int x
    }
    call add {
      input: a=x
    }
    output {
        Int sum = add.result
    }
}

task add {
  input {
    Int a
    Int b
  }
  command {}
  output {
    Int result = a + b
  }
}
```

The JSON inputs file below specifies `b`:
```
{
  "trivial.x" : 1,
  "trivial.add.b" : 3
}
```

In effect, missing call arguments are inputs to the workflow. This
also works for optional arguments. For example, if `add` has optional
argument `c`, then, it is possible to set it from a file:
```
{
  "trivial.x" : 1,
  "trivial.add.b" : 3,
  "trivial.add.c" : 10
}
```

This means that workflow `trivial` actually has four inputs: `{x,
add.a, add.b, add.c}`. A large realistic workflow makes many calls,
and has many hidden arguments. To implement this with a dnanexus
workflow, we need to materialize all these inputs, they cannot remain
hidden. The resulting platform workflow could easily have tens or
hundreds of inputs, making the user interface interface ungainly.
