# Topological Sort of WDL Workflow in dxWDL

When compiling a WDL workflow to a DNAnexus workflow, an initial pass
is performed to ensure that the workflow does not contain any directed
cycles and that calls to tasks are sorted in order of their
dependencies. The goal of performing this sort and check is to avoid
situations that could result in a deadlock or the execution of
workflows that are conceptually very difficult to understand the
execution upon reading them. Since this is not a completely trivial
task, this documentation exists to discuss the basics and then go onto
more advanced aspects of the sorting.

## Basics

In general, a workflow can be thought of as a directed graph where any
edge `(v,w)` in the graph represents that data required for `w`
depends on the data in `v`.  Most practical bioinformatics workflows
do not directed contain cycles in this graph (though some workflows
more complex conditional interpretation of inputs and outputs may).
In this sense the workflow is a directed acyclic graph (DAG) and the
node sets of these types of graphs can be efficiently sorted in order
of dependencies for both ordering execution and improving readability
of the workflow.

In the case of a simple WDL file, this is fairly straightforward.  For example:

```scala
task add {
    Int x
    Int y
    command { }
    output { Int r = x + y }
}

workflow w {
    call add as C { input: x = A.r, y = 0 }
    call add as B { input: x = 3, y = 0 }
    call add as D { input: x = B.r, y = C.r }
    call add as A { input: x = 0, y = 0 }
}
```

Here, both A and B depend on no calls, C depends on the result of A,
and D depends on the result of B and C.  Graphically this looks like:

```

A -> C ---> *-----*
            |  D  |
B --------> *-----*
```

The topological sorting will simply create an ordering like the one
graphically depicted above where the nodes of the graph are sorted in
a way that guarantees that no job v that w depends on will appear
after w in the sorted list.

## More Complex Issues

WDL also supports more complex workflows.  Specifically, the concept
of a `scatter` makes the process of sorting, and even defining the DAG
bit more difficult.  Here is an example:

```scala
task concat {
    String a
    String b
    command {
       echo ${a} ${b} > foo.txt
    }
    output {
       String result = read_string("foo.txt")
         # Or read from stdout
    }
    runtime {
       # Docker image info etc ...
    }
}

task gather {
    Array[Array[String]] strings
    # ...
}

workflow {
    String a
    String b
    Array[String] xs = ["1","2","3"]
    call concat as cat { input: a = a, b = b }
    scatter (x in xs) {
        call concat as scat { input a = x, b = b }
        call concat as tcat { input a = scat.result, b = b }
        scatter (x in xs) {
            call concat as ncat { input a = tcat.result, b = b }
        }
    }
    call gather { strings = tcat.result }
}
```

The body of a `scatter` can contain what appears to be an arbitrary
‘sub workflow’.  However, this ‘sub workflow’ can be dependent on
tasks anywhere outside the scatter context.  This makes the sorting
problem a bit more difficult, and in particular can result in some
hard-to-read workflows.

## Default sorting procedure: `--sort_method=scatter_collapse`

By default, we conceptually build a DAG at every level of the AST
hierarchy and perform a topological sort the nodes within that level.
This implies that we **require** that at every level of the AST the
graph is a DAG and there is no cycle.

For example, any dependencies between descendants of two scatters will
be dependencies of the parent scatters.  If this causes a cycle,
compilation of the dxWDL workflow will error out:

```scala
task add {
    Int x
    Int y
    command { }
    output { Int r = x + y }
}

workflow W {
    Array[Int] xs
    scatter (x in xs) {
        call add as A { input: x = C.r, y = 0 }
        call add as B { input: x = 3, y = 0 }
    }
    scatter (x in xs) {
        call add as C { input: x = 1, y = 2 }
        call add as D { input: x = B.r, y = 0 }
    }
}
```

Here, `A` depends on the result of `C` and `D` depends on the result
of `B`.  This is not strictly a cycle, however in some senses, each
scatter operation at the top level is dependent on one another.  More
complex examples of this kind could cause difficulty in understanding
the execution of a workflow.

The structure of this 'scatter collapsing' recursion looks like this
at a high level (pseudocode):

```
# Returns a list of sorted nodes
tsort(edges)

# Returns a sorted workflow
sortWorkflow(workflow) {
    # Top level children of a workflow
    tsortASTNodes(wf.children)
}

# Sorts nodes at a particular level in the AST
tsortASTNodes(nodes) {
    recursedNodes = nodes.map [
        if node is scatter:
              newScatter(tsortASTNodes(scatter.children))
          else:
              node
    ]

    # Build dependency graph at this level
    edges  = # ...
    tsort(edges)
}
```

Building the graph (list of edges) itself is somewhat complex because
of the requirement where we conceptually ‘collapse’ a scatter.
Building this ‘scatter collapsed’ graph requires resolving two
important cases:

Case 1:

Let `descendants(scatter)` be the set of all AST nodes recursively
within a particular scatter and let `dependents(descendants(scatter))`
be the set nodes **dependent** on those descendants.  Any dependent
node outside the scatter context (`dependents(descendants(scatter)) -
descendants(scatter) - {scatter}`) should become a dependent of the
scatter context itself.

Case 2:

If any node `v` in the current level of the AST has a parent within a
scatter context at this level, make `v`’s parent the scatter itself.

Regarding implementation of this type of algorithm, one approach is to
define a separate graph with node types for a new 'scatter collapsed'
graph and recursively build this graph.  This new graph type will
eventually have to be converted back into nodes in the original WDL
AST.  The other approach is rely solely on nodes in the WDL AST to
build the graph (in other words, /any/ graph topologically sorted in
the AST will consist of nodes in the AST itself.  We opted for the
latter approach though both have their advantages and disadvantages.

## Alternative sorting procedure: `--sort_method=relaxed`

Conceptually there are two major ways sorting a WDL workflow can be
implemented. The procedure above is fairly strict in the sense that
dependencies within scatters are 'collapsed' and propoagated up to
scatters at each level.  It may be the case that, in some cases, it is
more succinct and desirable to allow more complex dependencies between
scatters as displayed in the example earlier. In this case, one can
first topologically sort the dependency graph overlayed over the AST
(i.e. all nodes at any depth in the AST). This sorted list of AST
graph nodes can be used as an input to a recursion filtering for only
the nodes at a particular level in the AST. This does not collapse
scatters and thus allows the the types of dependencies between
scatters exhibited above that may make a workflow difficult to read.
Here is an example:

```scala

task T {
    Int x
    Int y
    output { Int res = x + y }
}

workflow W {
    Array[Int] xs

    scatter (x in xs) {
        call T as B { input: x = x, y = A.res }
    }

    call T as A { input: x = 1, y = 2 }
}
```

Here, `B` depends on `A.res`  However the scatter only really depends on `xs`.  Therefore without the scatter collapsing there is no way at the top level that the sorting procedure knows to place `A` before the scatter.


Psuedocode for the procedure:

```
# Returns a list of sorted nodes
tsort(edges)

# Returns a sorted workflow
sortWorkflowAlternative(workflow) {
    edges = # directed graph built from ALL nodes in the AST
    allNodesSorted = tsort(edges)
    # Top level children of a workflow
    tsortASTNodesAlternative(allNodesSorted, wf.children)
}

# Sorts nodes at a particular level in the AST
tsortASTNodesAlternative(allNodesSorted, nodes) {
    recursedNodes = nodes.map [
        if node is scatter:
              newScatter(tsortASTNodesAlternative(allNodesSorted, scatter.children))
          else:
              node
    ]

    filteredNodes = # Filter all sorted nodes by only those in the recursed nodes
}
```

## Are cycles OK?

Either sorting procedure above disallows cycles of dependencies
between nodes in the AST.  In general this is because the workflow may
not only be harder to read, but also introduce the possibility of
deadlocks or an infinite loop: e.g. the output of task A is dependent
on the output of task B, but the output of task B is also dependent on
the output of task A.  However, it could be the case, for example,
that task A and B both participate in an iterative optimization that
eventually converges.  If it is the case that more complex workflows
with cycles and the potential for deadlocks are desired and requested,
we will investigate the utility of supporting these kinds of
workflows.
